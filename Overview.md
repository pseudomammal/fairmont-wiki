Fairmont is a functional programming library that provides functions for everything from reactive programming to string manipulation to multi-methods. Specifically, Fairmont includes support for the following:

- Core functional programming
- Mult-methods
- Functional interfaces for built-in types
- Filesystem and Process interfaces for use with Node
- [[Reactive programming]]

You can use these individually as separate modules or as a whole. For example, if you only need the reactive programming functions, you can simply use the `fairmont-reactive` module.
