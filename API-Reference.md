## Core

Module: [`fairmont-core`][core]

The core functions are functions that provide the functional programming glue for JavaScript. Includes support for currying, partial application, and composition of functions.

### Core Functions

#### noOp

A function that does nothing and returns `undefined`. Useful in conjunction with combinators when you don't want to perform an action.

##### Example

```coffee
assert (noOp 7) == undefined
```

#### identity

Takes a value and returns it. Useful in conjunction with combinators when you don't want to transform a given value but simply return it unchanged.

##### Example

```coffee
assert (identity 7) == 7
```

#### wrap

Takes a value and returns a function that always returns the given value.

##### Example

```coffee
f = wrap 7
assert f() == 7
```

#### curry

Convert a function taking N arguments into a function that:
- given M < N arguments, returns another (curried) function taking N - M arguments
- given N arguments, runs the given function

##### Example

```coffee
slice = curry (begin, end, array) -> array.slice begin, end
truncate = slice 0
x = truncate 3, [1..5]
assert x.length == 3
```

#### _

Special value to allow for late-binding of an argument. See `partial`.

#### substitute

Given two arrays, substitute values from the second array for elements in the first array with the special value `_`.

##### Example

```coffee
ax = substitute [1, _, 3], [2]
assert ax[1] == 2
```


#### partial

Take a function and an argument list and return another function that takes its arguments and concatenates them with the first argument list, first performing argument substitution (see `substitute`).

##### Example

```coffee
{pow} = Math
square = partial pow, _, 2
assert (square 3) == 9
```

#### flip

Flip the arguments of the given function.

##### Example

```coffee
pow = curry flip Math.pow
square =  pow 2
assert (square 3) == 9
```

#### compose

Compose a list of functions, returning a new function.
You can compose functions returning promises (defined as returning a value having a `then` property) and you'll get a promise back, resolving to the result of the composition.

##### Example

```coffee
inverse = (x) -> 1/x
square = (x) -> x * x
inverseSquare = compose inverse, square
assert inverseSquare 5 == 1/25
```

#### pipe

Composition, except the functions arguments are in order of application.

##### Example

```coffee
a = (x) -> x + "a"
b = (x) -> x + "b"
ab = pipe a, b
assert (ab "S") == "Sab"
```

#### apply

Call a function with the given arguments. Useful when composing operations on functions.

##### Example

```coffee
assert (apply identity, 1) == 1
```

#### spread

Converts a function taking a list of arguments into a function taking an array.

##### Example

```coffee
cat = (a, b) -> a + b
catPair = spread cat
assert (catPair ["a", "b"]) == "ab"
```

#### unary, binary, and ternary

Take a given function taking a variable number of arguments and return one taking 1, 2, or 3 arguments. Useful in conjuction with `curry`.

##### Example

```coffee
f = -> a + b
g = curry binary f
a = g "a"
assert (a "b") == "ab"
```

#### negate

Take a given function and return a new function that passes its arguments to the given function and negates the return value.

##### Example

```coffee
_false = -> false
_true = negate _false
assert _true()
```

## Reactive

Module: [`fairmont-reactive`][reactive]

Reactive programming functions provide support for reactive programming based on JavaScript iterators.

### Iterators

Iterators are [defined in ES6][]:

> An object is an iterator when it knows how to access items from a collection one at a time, while keeping track of its current position within that sequence. In JavaScript an iterator is an object that provides a next() method which returns the next item in the sequence. This method returns an object with two properties: done and value.

In Fairmont, we refer to such an object, in general, as a _product_.

[defined in ES6]:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators

#### isIterable

A simple predicate that returns true if the argument is iterable.
This is simple enough: it should have a `Symbol.iterator` property.
However, generators in Node don't look like iterables (yet?).
So we also return true for generators.

##### Example

```coffee
assert isIterable [1..5]
assert !(isIteratable 7)
```

#### isIterator

A predicate that returns true if the argument is an iterator.
Iterators are iterable (that is, they have a `Symbol.iterator` property) and also have a `next` property whose value is a function.

##### Example

```coffee
assert isIterator iterator [1..5]
```

#### iterator

The `iterator` function takes a given value and attempts to return an iterator using the value.
If the value is an iterable, we simply call the function returned by the `Symbol.iterator` property.
If the value is a already an iterator, we simply return it.
If the value is a generator, we call the generator.
If the value is a function, we assign it's `Symbol.iterator` and `next` properties to itself, and return it. (This makes it possible to convert arbitrary functions into iterators, too.)

##### Example

```coffee
i = iterator [1..5]
assert 1 == value next i
assert 2 == value next i
assert 3 == value next i
assert 4 == value next i
assert 5 == value next i
assert isDone next i
```

#### next

Given an iterator or reactor, return a product. Equivalent to calling `i.next()` for a given iterator `i`.

#### value

Returns the `value` property from a product. Equivalent to calling `x.value` for a given object `x`.

#### isDone

Returns the `done` property from a product. Equivalent to calling `x.done` for a given object `x`.

### Reactors

Reactors are Fairmont's term for asynchronous iterators.
Asynchronous iterators are an ES7 proposal.
Instead of returning products, asynchronous iterators (reactors) return Promises that resolve to products (objects with `done` and `value` properties).

#### isReagent

Analogous to `isIterable`.
A predicate that returns true if its operand is an asynchronous iterator.
Specifically, returns true if the `Symbol.asyncIterator` property is defined and is a function.

Since reactors are based on an ES7 proposal, there are no built-in types that are asynchronous iterables. Fairmont provides a variety of functions for adapting values to reactors. See `reactor`.

##### Example

In this example, `events` is a function that takes an event producer and returns a reactor whose products are the given event. See [`events`](#events).


```coffee
button[Symbol.asyncIterator] = -> events "click", button
assert isReagent button
```

#### isReactor

Analogous to `isIterator`.
A predicate that returns true if its operand is a reactor.
Reactors are reagents (that is, they have a `Symbol.asyncIterator` property) and also have a `next` property whose value is a function.

##### Example

In this example, `events` is a function that takes an event producer and returns a reactor whose products are the given event. See [`events`](#events).

```coffee
r = (events "click", button)
assert isReactor r
```

#### reactor

Analogous to `iterator`. The `reactor` function takes a given value and attempts to return an reactor using the value.
If the value is a reagent, we simply call the function returned by the `Symbol.asyncIterator` property.
If the value is already a reactor, we simply return it.
If the value is a function, we assign its `Symbol.asyncIterator` and `next` properties to itself, and return it. (This makes it possible to convert arbitrary functions into reactors, too.)

If you want to use a generator function as an semi-coroutine, simply pass it in via the [`async`](#async) helper function to convert it into a promise-returning function, and then call `reactor` with the resulting function.

##### Example

In this example, `events` is a function that takes an event producer and returns a reactor whose products are the given event. See [`events`](#events).

```coffee
button[Symbol.asyncIterator] = -> events "click", button
r = reactor button
assert isReactor r
```

### Observers

Observer functions provide a way to asynchronously observe changes to values. The observer receives a temporally ordered sequence of notifications based on changes to the observed value.

#### observe

Given an object or an array value, returns an event emitter that generates events when the value is changed.

##### Example

```coffee
x = value: 7
events = observe x
events.on "change", (x) -> y = x.value
x.value = 3
assert y == 3
```

### Adapters

Adapters are functions that create iterators or reactors (aka, producers) from an existing value, like an Array or an event emitter.

#### producer

Given a producible (that is, an iterable or reagent), or a Promise that resolves into a producible, returns a corresponding producer. Idempotent: if the operand is a already producer, it is simply returned.

##### Example

```coffee
i = producer [1..5]
assert i.next().value == 1
```

#### pull

Given an iterator whose product values are Promises, returns a reactor. This is useful if an iterator is used in combination with an asynchronous function.

##### Example

Let's suppose we want a function that will convert an iterator that produces pathnames into a reactor producing hashes for the contents of the corresponding files. We might implement it like this.

```coffee
hashFiles = (pathnames) ->
  flow [
    pathnames
    map (pathname) -> read pathname
    map (promise) ->
      promise.then (content) -> md5 content
  ]
```

The appearance of the promise is due to the fact that `read` returns a promise that resolves when the read operation completes. In turn, that means our product `value` is going to be a promise, too. We basically have a reactor in the form of an iterator.

We can use `pull` to avoid this problem.

```coffee
hashFiles = (pathnames) ->
  flow [
    pathnames
    map (pathname) -> read pathname
    pull
    map (content) -> md5 content
  ]
```

Our `hashFiles` function now returns a reactor instead of an iterator whose prouct values are promises.

#### combine

Given two or more producers, combines them into a single producer whose products are those of the given producers in aggregate.

##### Example

In the example below, `updates` is an array of reactors producing update functions, perhaps in response to `change` events for fields of a form.

```coffee
go [
  combine updates...
  map (update) -> update data
]
```

#### repeat

Given a value, returns an iterator that always produces that value. Analogous to `wrap`for an iterator.

##### Example

```coffee
alwaysTrue = repeat true
assert alwaysTrue.next()
```

#### events

Given an event name and an event emitter, returns a reactor whose products are the events corresponding to the given event name. You can also pass in a dictionary of event names, which makes it possible to specify error and end event names. Otherwise, these default to `error` and `end`.

##### Example

```coffee
clickStream = events "click", button
```

#### stream

Given a stream object, returns a reactor whose products correspond to those of the stream. This is useful for treating a stream as a reactor.

##### Example

```coffee
tokens = fold [], cat, [
  stream fs.createReadStream path
  map (chunk) -> chunk.split /\s+/
]
```

#### flow

Given an producer and a list of functions, composes the functions (via [`pipe`](#pipe)) and then invokes the resulting function with the producer, returning another producer.

##### Example

```coffee
squares = (numbers) ->
  flow [
    numbers
    map (n) -> n * n
  ]

i = squares [1..5]
assert i.next() == 1
assert i.next() == 4
```

The `flow` function makes it easier to do reactive programming. For example, here's a simple Web app implementing a counter.

```coffee
data = counter: 0

start flow [
  events "click", $("a[href='#increment']")
  map -> data.counter++
]

start flow [
  events "change", observe data
  map ->
    $("p.counter")
    .html data.counter
]
```

You can find more examples in the [`fairmont-reactive` repo](https://github.com/pandastrike/fairmont-reactive/tree/master/examples).

### Filters

Filters transform producers into other producers.

#### map

Given a function and a producer, returns a new producer whose products are obtained by applying the function to the products of the given producer.


#### accumulate

Like `reduce`, except produces the values for each iteration.

#### select/filter

Given a function and an iterator, return an iterator that produces values from the given iterator for which the function returns true.

#### reject

Given a function and an iterator, return an iterator that produces values from the given iterator for which the function returns false.

#### project

#### compact

#### partition

#### take

Given a function and an iterator, return an iterator that produces values from the given iterator until the given function returns false when applied to the given iterator's values.

#### takeN

Given an iterator, produces the first N values from the given iterator.

#### where

Performs a `select` using a given object object. See `query`.

#### split

Given a function and an iterator, produce a new iterator whose values are delimited based on the given function.

#### lines

#### tee

#### throttle

#### pump

Write the values produced by the iterator to a stream.

### Reducers

Some functions _reduce_ an iterator into another value. Once a reduce function is introduced, the associated iterator functions will run.

#### fold/reduce

Given an initial value, a function, and an iterator, reduce the iterator to a single value, ex: sum a list of integers.

#### foldr/reduceRight

Given function and an initial value, reduce an iterator to a single value, ex: sum a list of integers, starting from the right, or last, value.

#### collect

Collect an iterator's values into an array.

#### each

Apply a function to each element but discard the results. This is a reducer because there isn't any point in having an iterator that simply discards the value from another iterator. Basically, use `each` when you want to reduce an iterator without taking up any additional memory.

#### start

Works like `each` but doesn't apply a function to each element. This is useful with producers that encapsulate operations, like request processing in a server or handling browser events.

#### any

Given a function and an iterator, return true if the given function returns true for any value produced by the iterator.

#### all

Given a function and an iterator, return true if the function returns true for all the values produced by the iterator.

#### zip

Given a function and two iterators, return an iterator that produces values by applying a function to the values produced by the given iterators.

#### unzip

#### assoc

Given an iterator that produces associative pairs, return an object whose keys are the first element of the pair and whose values are the second element of the pair.

#### flatten

#### sum

Sum the numbers produced by a given iterator.

#### average

Average the numbers producced by a given iterator.

#### join

Concatenate the strings produced by a given iterator. Unlike `Array::join`, this function does not delimit the strings. See also: `delimit`.

This is here instead of in [String Functions](./string.litcoffee) to avoid forward declaring `fold`.

#### delimit

Like `join`, except that it takes a delimeter, separating each string with the delimiter. Similar to `Array::join`, except there's no default delimiter. The function is curried, though, so calling `delimit ' '` is analogous to `Array::join` with no delimiter argument.

#### benchmark

Run a function an record how long it took. Use this in conjunction with `times` to benchmark a function over N repetitions.

#### empty

Returns true if a contains no value. For arrays and strings, this means that its length is zero. For an object, it means that `keys` returns an array of length zero. For any other value, it will return true unless it's `undefined`.

#### length

Returns the length property of an object. This is so frequently used with strings and arrays that it's reasonable to include it. We were tempted to add a variant for objects, but that could produce surprising results. Instead, just use `length keys object`, which is still much more readable than `Object.keys(foo).length`. And, of course, if you're just comparing to zero, use `empty`: `empty foo` works on objects.

#### deepEqual

## Process

### Process Functions

#### abort

Simple wrapper around `process.exit(-1)`, optionally taking a message.

##### Example

```coffee
abort "Cap'n she can't hold any longer!"
```

#### shell

Execute a shell command. Returns a promise that resolves to an object with properties `stdout` and `stdin`, or is rejected with an error.

## File System

### File System Functions

#### stat

Synchronously get the stat object for a file.

#### exists

Check to see if a file exists.

#### read

Read a file and return a UTF-8 string of the contents.

Passing an explicit 'null'/`undefined` or 'binary'/'buffer' as the encoding will return the raw buffer.

You can also just pass in a readable stream.

#### readDir / readdir

Get the contents of a directory as an array.

#### ls

Get the contents of a directory as an array of pathnames.

#### lsR / lsr

Recursively get the contents of a directory as an array.

#### glob

Glob a directory.

#### write

Synchronously write a UTF-8 string or data buffer to a file.

#### chDir / chdir

Change directories. If a function is passed in execute the function, and restore the original working directory. Otherwise, returns a function to restore the original working directory. **Important** Do not rely on the automatic restoration feature when using asynchronous functions, since another function may also change the current directory.

#### rm

Removes a file.

#### rmDir / rmdir

Removes a directory.

#### isDirectory

#### isFile

#### mkDir / mkdir

Creates a directory. Takes a `mode` and a `path`. Assumes any intermediate directories in the path already exist.

#### mkDirP / mkdirp

Creates a directory and any intermediate directories in the given `path`. Takes a `mode` and a `path`.

## Multimethods

[Multimethods][1] are polymorphic functions on their arguments. Methods in JavaScript objects dispatch based only on the (implicit first argument, which is the) object itself. Multimethods provide a more functional and flexible approach.

[1]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch

The `dispatch` function is the soul of the multimethod implementation. Our approach is iterate through all the available method implementations (`entries`) and find the best match by checking each argument (given by `ax`).

We score each match based on a set of precedence rules, from highest to lowest:

* A predicate match, ex: `even` for matching an argument that is an even number

* A value match, ex: `5` for matching a specific value

* A type match, defined by a match against the argument's constructor function

* A inherited type match, defined by `instanceof` returning true

All the arguments must match, otherwise the score is zero. If no match is found, the `default` method will be selected.

The method definition can either be a value or a function. If it's a function, the function is run using the given arguments. Otherwise, the value is returned directly.

For definitions which the value is itself a function, you must wrap the function inside another function. The `dispatch` function is not exposed directly.

A map function allows for the transformation of the arguments for matching purposes. For example, variadic functions can be implemented by simply providing a variadic map function that returns the arguments as an Array.

The `method` function defines a new multimethod, taking an optional description of the method. This can be accessed via the `description` property of the method.

The `define` function adds an entry into the dispatch table. It takes the method, the signature, and the definition (implementation) as arguments.
